  <Mech_Lancer.description>A human-sized combat mechanoid with huge optical sensors on its face for aiming weapons at range. While effective at distance, it is weaker in melee combat. Veterans of mechanoid wars know that often, the safest thing to do against an sentinel is to charge in and engage in melee combat.\n\nSentinels that are wielding charge lances are known as lancers, wielding a deadly charge weapon that can server or destroy limbs with deadly accuracy.</Mech_Lancer.description>
