  <description>Armory of the New and Lost Age or ANLA for short, is a mod that expands the aresenal of weapons into the rims, focusing on adding a variety of weapon selection from neolithic and medieval to the 18th centruy to the 21th centruy weaponry ranging from pistols, submachine guns, rifles, shotguns, bows, melee weapons and a few new helmets and balance changes to the vanilla weapons, armor and gear.
  \nWhile also increasing the danger of the raids including new raider types making the daily life in the rims slightly more dangerous and deadly while also keeping the style in line with vanilla. \n\nThis is a Alpha version of the mod. So don't expect things to go smoothly.</description>
